* About
A last ditch attempt to quickly port code from ~SciPy~ to ~C++~.

#+begin_quote
This has no official relationship to either ~xtensor~ or ~scipy~!!!
#+end_quote

Anyway, with that out of the way, this is part of the larger ~xtsci~ project,
which iteratively implements parts of ~scipy~ using ~xtensor~ and modern C++
based on my needs. At some point (or with funding) this might cover all of
~scipy~, but its really more of a rapid prototyping thing.
